Fix rescaling by adopting a different strategy: use mouse scroll instead, +/- 5% each time ?
Seems easier to control width/height accurately and safely in this way...

Impossible to play / triple move in Doublemove : turn issues, maybe because a move is sent twice to the server...
=> solution = sign (hash?) moves, and if an already received signature received again, ignore?

add variants : Chakart first (dark,cylinder)
Dark Racing Kings ?
Checkered-Teleport ?

Otage, Emergo, Pacosako : fonction "buildPiece(arg1, arg2)" returns HTML element with 2 SVG or SVG + number
réfléchir aux animations par variante (reversi, Chakart, Atomic, ...)
