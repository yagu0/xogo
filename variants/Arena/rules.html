<p>
  Only moves ending in the Arena zone (where no piece stand initially)
  are allowed. If starting from inside the Arena, then a move must capture
  something.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>King and queen move like a queen restricted to 3 squares.</li>
  <li>Pawns can capture backwards.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  The first player who cannot make a move loses.
  A player who lose both king and queen also lose the game.
