<p>
  Moves are potentially played in two times:
  move a piece, and / or push or pull something with that unit.
</p>

<p>Each turn, a player has the following options:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Move one of his pieces normally,
    then optionally pull something as an effect of this move.
  </li>
  <li>
    Push any piece with one of his pieces,
    then optionally follow the pushed piece.
  </li>
</ul>
