<h1>Baroque Rules</h1>

<div>
  <h4>Pieces names</h4>
  <p>Pieces names refer to the way they capture, which is described later.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Pawn : Pawn or Pincer</li>
    <li>Rook : Coordinator</li>
    <li>Knight : Long Leaper</li>
    <li>Bishop : Chameleon</li>
    <li>Queen : Withdrawer</li>
    <li>King : King (same behavior as in standard chess)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    There is also a new piece : the immobilizer,
    represented by an upside-down rook.

  <h3>Non-capturing moves</h3>
  <p>
    Pawns move as orthodox rooks, and the king moves as usual,
    one square in any direction.
    All other pieces move like an orthodox queen.
  </p>
  <p>
    When a piece is adjacent to an enemy immobilizer, it cannot move unless
    the enemy immobilizer is adjacent to a friendly immobilizer or chameleon
    (cancelling the powers of the opponent's immobilizer).
  </p>
  <p>
    Note : this corresponds to the "pure rules" described on
    <a href="http://www.inference.org.uk/mackay/ultima/ultima.html">
      this page
    </a>
    , which slightly differ from the initial rules.
    The aim is to get rid of the weird suicide rule by weakening the
    immobilizers lock. In particular, in the original rules two adjacent
    immobilizer are stuck forever until one is captured. Note that it's still
    the case if all chameleons disappeared.
  </p>
</div>

<div>
  <h3>Capturing moves</h3>
  <p>
    Easy case first: the king captures as usual, by moving onto an adjacent
    square occupied by an enemy piece. But this is the only piece following
    orthodox rules, and also the only one which captures by moving onto an
    occupied square. All other pieces capture passively: they land on a free
    square and captured units are determined by some characteristics of the
    movement.
  </p>
  <p>Note: the immobilizer does not capture.</p>

  <h4>Pawns/Pincers</h4>
  <p>
    If at the end of its movement a pawn is horizontally or vertically adjacent
    to an enemy piece, which itself is next to a friendly piece (in the same
    direction), the "pinced" unit is removed from the board.
  </p>

  </figure>

  <h4>Coordinators (rooks)</h4>
  <p>
    Imagine that rook and king of the same color are two corners of a rectangle
    (this works if these two pieces are unaligned).
    If at the end of a rook move an enemy piece stands in any of the two
    remaining corners, it is captured.
  </p>

  </figure>

  <h4>Long leapers (knights)</h4>
  <p>
    A knight captures exactly as a queen in international draughts game: by
    jumping over its enemies, as many times as it can/want but always in the
    same direction. In this respect it is less powerful than a draughts' queen:
    on the following diagram c8 or f6 cannot be captured.
    However, the knight does not have to maximize the number of captured units
    (as is the case in draughts).
  </p>

    </div>
    <figcaption>All marked squares captures are playable from d2.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <h4>Withdrawer (queen)</h4>
  <p>
    The queen captures by moving away from an adjacent enemy piece, in the
    opposite direction (without jumping, the path must be free).
  </p>

    <figcaption>1.Qa5, 1.Qb5 or 1.Qc5 captures the black rook.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <h4>Chameleon (bishop)</h4>
  <p>The chameleon captures pieces in the way they would capture. So, it</p>
  <ul>
    <li>pinces pawns (if moving like a pawn),</li>
    <li>withdraws from withdrawers,</li>
    <li>leaps over long leapers,</li>
    <li>coordinates coordinators.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>...and these captures can be combined.</p>
  <p>
    Remark: the move indicated on the diagram doesn't capture the black pincer
    on e5, since it is a diagonal move (not like a pawn).
  </p>
  <figure>
    <div class="diag"
      data-fen="7k/8/8/r3pP2/2n5/8/B7/K7 w 0"
      data-marks="a5,c4">
    </div>
    <figcaption>1.Bd5 captures the two marked pieces.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>
    Besides, chameleon immobilizes immobilizers (but cannot capture them since
    they do not capture).
  </p>
  <p>
    A chameleon captures the king in the same way the king captures, which
    means that a chameleon adjacent to a king gives check.
  </p>
</div>

<div>
  <h3>End of the game</h3>
  <p>
    The game ends by checkmate or stalemate as in standard chess. Note however
    that checks are more difficult to see, because of the exotic capturing
    rules. For example, on the following diagram the white king cannot move to
    e5 because then the black pawn could capture by moving next to it.
