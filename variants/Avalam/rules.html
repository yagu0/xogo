  At each turn, take any tower of less than 5 pieces (the number printed on it)
  and put it on an adjacent tower, such that the resulting construction isn't
  more than 5 units tall.

  When no moves are possible anymore, the game is over. The player having the
  largest number of towers of his color (on top) wins.
