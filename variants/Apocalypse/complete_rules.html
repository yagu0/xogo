<h1>Apocalypse Rules</h1>

<div>
  <p>
    Both players play a move "at the same time".
    The goal is to eliminate all enemy pawns.

  <p>
    This variant is inspired by the 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Horsemen_of_the_Apocalypse">
      Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse
    </a>
    mythology. Knights are horsemen, and pawns are footmen.
    If all footmen of one color die, the other side wins.
  </p>
  <p>
    At each turn you can decide either to play safely an apparently valid
    move, or speculate on your opponent's move and choose a move valid only
    conditionally on his choice. In this last case the move may end up not
    being playable: you would get a penalty point. Two penalty points loses
    the game. For example in the initial position, 1.(c1)c2 is safe while
    1.axb3 will be valid only if black plays 1...Nb3.

  <p>Resolving rules:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      If both moves are illegal none are played.
      If one is illegal, the other is played.
    </li>
    <li>
      If a capture is intended but the target moved, the move is still played
      without capturing anything.
    </li>
    <li>
      If both moves arrive on the same square: the illegal move prevails
      (if any), so the other piece vanishes (higher risk is rewarded).
      If both moves are legal, then a horseman wins over a footman,
      whereas two pieces of the same nature disappear.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Promotions</h3>
  <p>
    Pawns automatically promote in a knight, except if the player already
    have two horsemen on the board. In this case the footman is relocated on
    any free square which is not on last rank.
    Even in this last case, pawn promotions may appear possible by
    anticipation of a knight capture. This is risky but playable.
  </p>
  <h3>End of the game</h3>
  <p>
    As stated previously, losing all pawns lose the game, so promoting your
    last pawn loses. It may be the only legal move.
    If however both footmen armies vanish at the same time, it's a draw.
    It can happen if the two last pawns decide to advance to the same square
    for example.
    Finally, if both sides get the second penalty point at the same time
    it's also a draw.
