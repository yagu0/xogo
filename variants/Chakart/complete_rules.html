<h1>Chakart Rules</h1>

  <p>
    Pieces move as usual, but they all hide a special "power"
    inspired by Mario Kart:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      The pawn (Toad) leaves a "turbo" mushroom on its initial square,
      or on the intermediate one in case of a two squares move.
    </li>
    <li>
      The knight (Yoshi) let a surprise egg on its initial square.
      See about egg effect below.
    </li>
    <li>
      The rook (Donkey) put a banana on a square diagonally adjacent to the
      arrival one, at random, if possible.
    </li>
    <li>
      The bishop (Wario) put a bomb on a square orthogonally adjacent to the
      arrival one, at random, if possible.
    </li>
    <li>
      The queen (Mario) can play a stealth move once in the game:
      the opponent will only know that a queen moved - to an empty square.
      A promoted queen also has this power if not already used.
    </li>
    <li>
      The king (Peach) can "throw a shell" on an enemy reachable by a queen,
      once in the game. A promoted king also has this power, if not already
      used. The capture is done remotely without moving.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>The king cannot castle, and pawns don't capture en passant.</p>

    So the goal is to capture Peach :) If pawns promoted into king, then all
    of them must be captured. Since it still looked too easy, the 4 mentioned
    objects alter the move played, generally at random:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      A king or a pawn arriving on a mushroom advance one square further,
      while a knight jump another time in the same direction, if possible.
      Pawns can "eat" objects diagonally too.
      Mushrooms have no effect on sliders (queen, rook, bishop).
    </li>
    <li>
      A piece arriving on a banana (resp. bomb) is redirected at random by one
      square in an orthogonal (resp. diagonal) direction. If a piece (of any
      color!) stands on that square, then it is captured.
    </li>
    <li>
      The effects can cumulate, as illustrated on the diagram: the pawn
      "captures" the banana on e4, and is then redirected toward e5: mushroom,
      it jumps to the next square, which sends it on d5 eating the white rook.
      (We can imagine that the hope was to eat the black knight instead).
      A piece may ends on its initial square, move back, and so on. That being
      said, a given object can only be used once on the path.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The egg case is more complex: a move ending on an egg triggers an effect
    chosen at random, positive or negative. There are four bonus and four
    penalties. They are introduced in a dual form: first the positive, then
    the negative.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      King Boo (*B) let you exchange the position of any pair of pieces on the
      board.
    </li>
    <li>Koopa (*K) drives the piece back onto its initial square.</li>
    <li>
      Toadette (*T) allows to place a new &mdash; random &mdash; piece on the
      board. If the piece is dropped on an egg, banana or bomb, its effects
      are applied.
    </li>
    <li>
      Chomp (*C) eats the piece, which is thus captured. If it's Peach, then
      bad luck, game over :)
    </li>
    <li>Daisy (*D) allows to play again with any of your pieces.</li>
    <li>
      Bowser (*M) immobilizes the piece (which is surrounded by a light green
      halo). It won't be allowed to move on the next turn.
    </li>
    <li>Luigi (*L) changes the color of a random enemy piece.</li>
    <li>Waluigi (*W) changes the color of one of your pieces (at random).</li>
  </ul>
