<p>
  Queens, rooks, bishops and knights begin the game in a reserve below
  the board, because their location isn't determined yet.
  At each turn, you can either move something already defined on the board, or
</p>
<ol>
  <li>move a piece from your reserve to any question mark, and then</li>
  <li>move the now defined piece on the board.</li>
</ol>

<p>Your pieces remain in an undefined state until they are moved.</p>

<p>An undefined piece gives check if some specialization giving check exists.</p>

<h4>Details, special cases</h4>

<p>
  At the first move, you must select a square for the king anywhere on
  the first rank &mdash; preferably in a corner. This deviates from the
  original intention of the author, but this way you will not need to castle
  later in the game. Click on a square to place the king.
</p>

<p>
  If after your move all your pieces are defined (and weren't before), then
  all pieces on board revert to undefined state, unless:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    all your pieces (board + reserve) are now of the same type,
    in which case none is put back in reserve, or
  </li>
  <li>
    all opponent's pieces are of the same type, in which case
    they also remain defined.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  If one of your undefined pieces is captured, you first have to choose which
  one was captured from the reserve: place it at the capture location.
