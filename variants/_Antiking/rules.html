<p>
  The antiking (represented by an upside-down king)
  must always remain under attack.
  It can capture pieces of its color.
</p>

<p>
  Win by checkmating the king, or anti-mating the antiking &mdash; that is to
  say, making it unable to move to an attacked square.
</p>

<p>In Anti-King I,</p>
<ul>
  <li>Pawns are Berolina: they move diagonally and capture vertically.</li>
  <li>
    King and Antiking can play one non-capturing knight move,
    as long as they never moved earlier.
  </li>
</ul>
